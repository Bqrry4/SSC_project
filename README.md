# About

A man in the middle attack made more or less by hand as my project for the Cyberspace Security class. It uses DHCP starvation to set an evil dhcp server that will set the attacker as gateway upon new ip requests and DNS spoofing to assign a targeted domain name to a local http server that delivers malicious payloads by using CVE-2018-9958.
